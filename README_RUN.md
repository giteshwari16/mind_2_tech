# How to Run RapidRescue

You can run this web application in two ways:

### Option 1: Direct File Open (Easiest)
1.  Navigate to the `RapidRescue` folder on your desktop.
2.  Double-click `index.html`.
3.  The app will open in your default web browser.

### Option 2: Using the Helper Script (Recommended for "Server" experience)
1.  Open this folder in VS Code or Terminal.
2.  Run the python script `run_app.py`:
    ```bash
    python run_app.py
    ```
3.  This will start a local web server and automatically open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Option 3: VS Code "Launch"
1.  Open the "Run and Debug" tab in VS Code.
2.  Select "Launch Chrome against localhost" (We updated this to open the file directly).
3.  Press the Play button (Green triangle).
